A webapp for academic poster editing

TODOs
-----

* Make title editable, and have it reflect file saved to, and load it based off
  of file loaded.
* Sync CSS : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3326494/parsing-css-in-javascript-jquery
* Insert images / edit images : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18650168/convert-blob-to-base64
* CSS Themes
* Webfonts
* Edit title images
* Certainly issues with hard coded editing colors  and some ui placement that
  should at least get an adjustment for light or dark backgrounds or when
  certain formatting is changed.
* Use Ace or CodeMirror for better editing
* MathJax fonts may not be saved...
* Update licenses
* Get ripple effect on dynamically added menu buttons
* Zoom on poster (unsure how to do this properly)
